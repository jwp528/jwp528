# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Repository Overview
This is Josh Parsons' (aka Chaos) personal GitHub profile repository. It serves as a portfolio showcase highlighting his software development work, projects, and technical expertise.

## Repository Purpose
- **Primary Function**: Personal GitHub profile README and portfolio display
- **Content Type**: Primarily documentation, configuration, and showcase materials
- **Target Audience**: Potential employers, collaborators, and the developer community

## Technology Stack & Preferences
Josh works with a diverse technology stack including:
- **.NET** (primary focus, .NET 7+)
- **JavaScript/Node.js** 
- **PHP**
- **Vue.js** for frontend development
- **HTML5/CSS3/Sass** for styling
- **SQL/MySQL** for databases
- **Git/GitHub** for version control

## Coding Standards & Style
- Follow clean, readable code practices
- Use consistent indentation (spaces preferred for web technologies)
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Maintain professional tone in documentation
- Keep README badges and links up to date

## File Structure Guidelines
- **README.md**: Main profile content showcasing projects, skills, and links
- **.github/workflows/**: GitHub Actions for automation (blog post updates, etc.)
- **.github/**: Repository configuration and community files
- Keep the repository clean and organized with minimal clutter

## Content Maintenance
- **Projects Section**: Update with current active projects
- **Technology Icons**: Keep skills/tools section current with actual expertise

## Development Approach
- Make minimal, focused changes to avoid breaking existing functionality
- Test any workflow changes carefully
- Maintain responsive design principles for README display
- Keep external dependencies (badges, widgets) reliable and fast-loading

## Special Considerations
- This is a **public profile repository** - all content should be professional
- **Personal branding** is important - maintain consistent voice and presentation
- **Showcase projects** like "Reflected Identity" and "Scoped In" should be highlighted prominently
- **Social proof** elements (GitHub stats, badges) should remain functional

## Common Tasks
- Updating project descriptions and links
- Adding new technology skills to the stack
- Maintaining working status badges and widgets
- Updating social media links and contact information
- Ensuring all external links remain functional

## Avoid
- Adding unnecessary complexity to a showcase repository
- Breaking existing badge or widget functionality
- Making changes that could negatively impact professional presentation
- Adding sensitive or personal information
