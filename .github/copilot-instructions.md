- **Content Type**: Primarily documentation, configuration, and showcase materials
- **Target Audience**: Potential employers, collaborators, and the developer community

## Technology Stack & Preferences
Josh primarily uses the latest technologies including:
- **Latest .NET** (current focus)
- **C#** (primary language)
- **Blazor/Razor Pages** for web development
- **JavaScript** for frontend interactions
- **HTML5/CSS3/Sass** for styling

## Coding Standards & Style
- Follow clean, readable code practices
- Use consistent indentation (spaces preferred for web technologies)
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Maintain professional tone in documentation
- Keep README badges and links up to date

## File Structure Guidelines
- **README.md**: Main profile content showcasing projects, skills, and links
- **.github/workflows/**: GitHub Actions for automation (blog post updates, etc.)

## Development Approach
- Make minimal, focused changes to avoid breaking existing functionality
- Test any workflow changes carefully
- Maintain responsive design principles for README display
- Keep external dependencies (badges, widgets) reliable and fast-loading

## Special Considerations
- This is a **public profile repository** - all content should be professional
- **Personal branding** is important - maintain consistent voice and presentation
- **Showcase projects** like "Reflected Identity" and "Scoped In" should be highlighted prominently
- **Social proof** elements (GitHub stats, badges) should remain functional

## Common Tasks
- Updating project descriptions and links
- Adding new technology skills to the stack
- Maintaining working status badges and widgets
- Updating social media links and contact information
- Ensuring all external links remain functional

## Avoid
- Adding unnecessary complexity to a showcase repository
- Breaking existing badge or widget functionality
